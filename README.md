# Titanic_Prediction
Kaggle Competitions for Machine Learning
Kaggle - the platform for datasets hosts competitions where they provide the training and test sets and the problem statements and have a leaderboard
The goal is to submit your prediction as a csv file and reach the top of the leaderboard by improving your accuracy by making your machine learning algorithm precise and accurate by using steps like data exploration and cleaning to achieve better results
This is my first competition where we have to predict the survivors of the Titanic incident and my results were - 76% accuracy and 12895 rank
